"Comparison between experimental observation and theoretical analysis is a"
" crucial step in condensed-matter physics research. The tTemperature "
"dependence of specific heat and magnetic susceptibility, for example, has"
" been studied to extract the nature of low energy excitations of and "
"magnetic interactions between electrons, respectively, through comparison"
" with theories such as Landau's Fermi liquid theory and the Curie-Weiss "
"law."

"For the flexible and quantitative comparison of theoretical and  "
"experimental data, the exact diagonalization approach [1]_ is one of the "
"most reliable numerical tools that requires no approximation or "
"inspiration of genius. For the last few decades, a numerical "
"diagonalization package for quantum spin Hamiltonians, TITPACK, developed"
" by Prof. Hidetoshi Nishimori of Tokyo Institute of Technology, has been "
"widely used in the condensed-matter physics community. Nevertheless, "
"limited computational resources have hindered the ability of non-expert "
"users to apply the package to quantum systems with a large number of "
"electrons or spins."

"In contrast, the recent and rapid development of a parallel computing "
"infrastructure has opened up new avenues for user-friendly larger scale "
"diagonalizations up to 18-site Hubbard clusters or 36 :math:`S=1/2` "
"quantum spins. In addition, recent advances in quantum statistical "
"mechanics [2]_ [3]_ [4]_ [5]_ allow the finite temperature properties of "
"quantum many-body systems to be calculated at computational costs similar"
" to those of the calculations of ground state properties, which also "
"allows theoretical results for the temperature dependence of, for "
"example, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility, to be compared with "
"experimental results quantitatively [6]_ . To utilize the parallel "
"computing infrastructure with narrow bandwidth and distributed-memory "
"architectures, efficient, user-friendly, and highly parallelized "
"diagonalization packages are highly desirable."

":math:`{\\mathcal H}\\Phi`, a flexible diagonalization package for "
"solving quantum lattice Hamiltonians, has been developed as a descendant "
"of the pioneering package TITPACK. The Lanczos method for calculations of"
" the ground state and a few excited states properties, as well as finite "
"temperature calculations based on thermal pure quantum states [5]_ , are "
"implemented in the :math:`{\\mathcal H}\\Phi` package, with an easy-to-"
"use and flexible user interface. By using :math:`{\\mathcal H}\\Phi`, you"
" can analyze a wide range of quantum lattice Hamiltonians including "
"simple Hubbard and Heisenberg models, multi-band extensions of the "
"Hubbard model, exchange couplings that break the SU(2) symmetry of "
"quantum spins, such as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Kitaev interactions, and"
" Kondo lattice models describing itinerant electrons coupled with quantum"
" spins. :math:`{\\mathcal H}\\Phi` calculates a variety of physical "
"quantities, such as internal energy at zero temperature or finite "
"temperatures, temperature dependence of specific heat, and charge/spin "
"structure factors. A broad spectrum of users including experimental "
"scientists is cordially welcome."
