"We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Prof. Hidetoshi "
"Nishimori and Mr. Daisuke Tahara. Implementation of the Lanczos algorithm"
" in :math:`{\\mathcal H}\\Phi` written in C is based on the pioneering "
"diagonalization package TITPACK written in Fortran by Prof. Nishimori. "
"For developing the user interface of :math:`{\\mathcal H}\\Phi`, we "
"followed the design concept of the user interface in the program for "
"variational Monte Carlo developed by Mr. Tahara. A part of the user "
"interface in :math:`{\\mathcal H}\\Phi` is based on his original codes. "
"We would also like to express our thanks for the support of the "
"\\\"*Project for advancement of software usability in materials "
"science*\\\" of The Institute for Solid State Physics, The University of "
"Tokyo, for the development of :math:`{\\mathcal H}\\Phi` ver. 0.1 - ver. "
